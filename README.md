# rsmad



## Getting started

This is a wrapper around three IB libraries

 - ibmad
 - umad
 - netdisc

You need the headers for these libraries to be installed:

 - libibumad-dev
 - libibmad-dev
 - libibnetdisc-dev

These libraries are included with DOCA\OFED and MLNX OFED.

Take a look at the perfctrs project to see how to use this library.
